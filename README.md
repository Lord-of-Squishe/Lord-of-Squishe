Hello, I'm @Lord-of-Squishe, or known as Lord_of_Squishe on other platforms.
You can find me mainly on Discord, but I also have a ModDB account that I use frequently.

I work as a soundtrack composer for various Portal 2 mods, such as Shaft 06, Portal:Singularity Collapse, etc.,
I also do mapping and detailing work in Hammer,
I lead a mod called Portal:Electron,
That's pretty much all you really need to know lol
